### Asta is the short term for Automatically Sleep Terminate Assistant.

> #### This is the machine-learning-based project we have done at the university. 

* The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect sleepy driving and make alarms accordingly, which aims to prevent drivers from drowsy driving and create a safer driving environment. 

* The project was accomplished by a webcam that constantly takes images of drivers, a beagle board that implements an image processing algorithm for sleepy detection, a feedback circuit that could generate an alarm, and a power supply system.
